# NSA Manageable Network Plan

<p> This project is used to apply the security techniques I have learned from my classes to a real world environment. I applied  security principles and practices to maintain system operations in the presence of attacks or threats from a network by completing this project report. The guidelines for the plan are published by the National Security Agency, Information Assurance Directorate. 

A guide to generating this technical report can be found on the [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/2949885/nsa-details-network-infrastructure-best-practices/) website. 

In this project, I implemented 8 milestones and a network security plan. The milestones are divided into the following:
</p>

## Milestone 1: Began Preparation and Research for Document 
- Wrote down how I would use a blog or bulletin board to notify admins of changes
- Wrote down I  could use a wiki to document information and administration procedures
- Wrote what I think are important documents and how/where they would be collected and organized
- Posted about the tools and procedures I might use to create central documentation authority that handles document tracking enforcement of documentation consistency. 
- Posted the important information I might want to record and track, such as: Network devices, Network security policy, Network administration changes, Procedures used to communicate, for example RSS feeds, Management tracking, Self-Help utilities that allow users to understand and solve their own problems

## Milestone 2: Mapping My Network
Used NMAP to: 
- Create an accurate map of my current network (network topology).
- Create an accurate list of ALL devices on my network
- Create a list of ALL protocols that are running on the network.
- Recorded my results in a tables
## Milestone 3: Protecting My Network (Network Architecture/Identify High-Value Assets/Damage Containment)
- Backup Strategy
- Data-at-Rest
- Network Monitoring
- Incident Response and Recovery
## Milestone 4: Reaching My Network (Device Accessibility)
- Security Gateways/Firewalls
- Proxies
## Milestone 5: Controlling My Network (User Access)
- Least Privilege
- Remote Access Security
- Network Access Control
## Milestone 6: Managing My Network Part 1 (Patch Management)
  - Discussed and determined how to search and implement patches on the network
## Milestone 7: Managing My Network Part 2 (Baseline Management)
- Virus Scanning/HIPS
- PED Management
- Executable Content Restrictions
## Milestone 8: Documenting My Network
 - Finalized my documentation for the network
 - Began to implement my plan of action
